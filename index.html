                        Picture Rocky Balboa in a triumphant victory lap through St Petersburg.
                        Only this time, it’s not a Cold War nemesis whom he has conquered,
                        but the State Russian Museum. An exhibition of works by the action
                        hero Sylvester Stallone opened to the public in the Russian capital
                        on Monday. “Sylvester Stallone, painting: from 1975 until today”, is
                        on view at one of the country’s most important museums, known for its
                        Russian classics and religious icons (until 13 January 2014). A communist
                        organisation has already denounced the show. “You know that he called for
                        war against the USSR and in the movies killed our soldiers,” wrote the
                        Communist Party of Leningrad Oblast, referring to Stallone and his other
                        iconic character in an appeal last week. “Rambo isn’t necessary to us,
                        his pictures aren’t necessary, his pornography isn’t necessary!!!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="article-1-quotesf">
                            Rambo isn’t necessary to us,
                            his pictures aren’t necessary, his pornography isn’t necessary!!!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That didn’t stop scores of Stallone’s fans, who stood in a snaking
                        line for Sunday’s opening, where the museum director Vladimir Gusev
                        called Sly “a real artist”.

                        Have you ever wondered what Olafur
                        Eliasson-infused cheese tastes like? Or
                        been desperate to discover what is inside
                        mega-curator Hans-Ulrich Obrist's nostrils?
                        Now you can find out courtesy of a new
                        exhibition at the Science Gallery,
                        Trinity College in Dublin ("Grow Your Own:
                        Life After Nature", until 19 January 2014).
                        According to the dezeen.com blog, the US
                        scientist Christina Agapakis and Norwegian
                        scent expert Sissel Tolaas collected
                        bacteria from Obrist's nose and Eliasson's
                        tears, then turned the cultures into
                        "human cheese".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The "Selfmade" project features
                        11 cheeses in total, but Eliasson and Obrist's
                        rather scientific intervention is not as
                        stomach-churning as chef Michael Pollan's
                        contribution; he gallantly gave the contents
                        of his belly button to create the most pungent of cheeses.

                        It’s the family that just keeps on giving.
                        Two pivotal works by Henri Matisse have been
                        donated to the Centre Pompidou in Paris by the
                        artist’s heirs. Barbara Duthuit, the widow of
                        the artist’s grandson Claude, gave the painting
                        Fillette au Chat Noir (Marguerite), 1910, and the
                        gouache découpées (paper cut-out) La Jérusalem Céleste,
                        1948, to the Musée National d’Art Moderne based at
                        the Centre Pompidou in October.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The former work depicts
                        the artist’s daughter, aged 14; La Jérusalem Céleste is
                        a study for Matisse’s stained-glass window at the Rosary
                        Chapel in Vence, south-eastern France. “Since the 1970s,
                        Matisse’s heirs have generously enriched French national
                        collections through their donations,” said a press statement.
                        Early last year, Matisse’s descendants donated a series of
                        paper collages and cut-outs dating from 1945 to 1954 to the
                        Matisse Museum in Le Cateau-Cambrésis, northern France.

                            The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimates that,
                            in the past six years alone, it has returned more than 6,600
                            looted artefacts and works of art to their rightful owners.
                            A recently released list of its “Top Ten Repatriations” reads
                            like an Indiana Jones screenplay. ICE’s greatest hits include
                            the recovery of a 3,000-year-old Egyptian sarcophagus; a pair
                            of eighth-century Neo-Assyrian earrings taken from Iraq; and

                            auction catalogue. Non-art items include a Tyrannosaurus
                            Bataar skeleton looted from Mongolia.

                        Snowbirds look forward to Art Basel Miami Beach.
                        It’s a chance to get away from the cold and frost of New York,
                        London or Paris. So, they may be surprised to find that the
                        winter will be following them this year. An installation at
                        Miami’s Marine Stadium by the French art duo Kolkoz
                        (opening 5 December) involves the construction of a
                        floating chalet, presumably covered in false snow.
                        The project is sponsored by Galerie Perrotin and the
                        Swiss watch-maker Audemars Piguet, whose “wintery home
                        in the Vallée du Joux” is the inspiration for the work.
